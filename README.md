This repo contains the code and documentation for my final year university major project. The purpose of this project was to develop an interface to manage large mobile robots using ROS. The application runs on the robot itself but can also be used remotely in a terminal. The interface is entirely textual to allow for running without a graphical environment which is typical of the types of robots it is used for. The application allows the user to run a set of commands defined in the config file by using the UI to select or click/tap the corresponding menu item. The output of these processes can be viewed in a tabbed environment and can also be terminated. The robot can also be controlled using the arrow keys. The behaviour for the control (ie. velocity increments) is also configurable. More information about the features and development of this project can be found in the "Final Report" directory. Information about using the application as well as the source code can be found in the "robot_manager" directory.
